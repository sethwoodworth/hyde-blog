      The <a href="http://webecologyproject.org">Web Ecology Project</a> was a research
      collective based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Our agenda was to apply quantitative social
      science to social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      We released our first report <span class="date">June 02009</span>, <em>The Iranian Election on Twitter:
      The First Eighteen Days</em>. In this report we analysed over two million tweets
      collected in a 19 day window during the events of the Iran election and subsiquent
      protests. This report, and all subsiquent reports have been released under a <span class="libre">Creative
      Commons license</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a part of Web Ecology, I wrote software to collect and analyse data from various
      social networks. As the systems administrator, I managed a cluster of GNU/Linux
      servers running postgres and mysql databases numbering in the hundreds of millions.
      As part of the research team, I prepared qualitative analysis for published reports, 
      and as business manager I produced research funding proposals, attended conferences, 
      and pursued commercial contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further research has been released exploring influence in social networks and competition
      among group consensus in online platforms to
      <a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/press/">media acclaim</a>.

        I started my involvement with the One Laptop per Child project in 2005, trying to get involved
        in organizing and manging Open Educational Resourcs. I saw the XO laptop as an
        obvious method for delivering edual content with a permissive license.

      <p>
        We started getting press and links the day of launch, a solid review from <a href="http://www.killerstartups.com/Web-App-Tools/beta-yawnlog-com-a-new-sleep-tracker"> Killer Startups</a>, an article in <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yawnlog_a_social_sleep_tracker.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>, an episode of the <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/how-to-track-your-sleep-habits/"> Chris Pirillo show</a>, and a mention by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2009/02/26/26readwriteweb-yawnlog_a_social_sleep_tracker.html"> New York Times</a>.

        Public domain works are an important part of creativity and generativity on the internet
        and elsewhere. US government produced works are in the public domain, but not always easy
        to access. Taking initiative from projects like
        <a href='http://public.resource.org'>public.resource.org</a> I took it upon myself to
        index, archive, and re-publish a 30,000+ <a href-'http://phil.cdc.gov'>image library</a>
        from the CDC.

        <a href="http://librivox.org">Librivox</a> is a collection of audio books read by volunteers
        and released into the public domain. It was founded in August
        <span class="date">02005</span> and I joined the group
        in <span class="date">January 02006</span>. I am proud to have read, recorded and submitted a

        I study and practice 15c. German longsword. There are a large collection of extant
        manuscripts from the <span class="date">01300's</span> until the modern day, describing the use of swords
        and other weapons as a Western Martial Art. I practice in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Liechtenauer">Liechtenauer</a>
        tradition, but other schools exist, some of which I've dabbled in.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was a part of an organization that performed educational demonstrations on
        medieval and renaissance martial arts, arms and armor. We performed at schools, libraries,
        and museums throughout the pacific northwest, notably the Seattle Art Museum's
        <em>Spain in the Age of Exploration</em> exhibit in <span class="date">02004</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stage combat and performance is a big part of demonstrations like this. I've had the
        opportunity to act and perform stage combat on a few occasions, one of which resulted in
        an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3736097/">imdb</a> entry.
